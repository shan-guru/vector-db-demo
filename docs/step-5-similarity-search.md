# Step 5: Similarity Search

Once data is indexed, we can query Milvus using vector similarity.

## Example Flow

1. User asks a question
2. Question is converted into an embedding
3. Milvus performs a **similarity search**
4. Top-K relevant results are returned

This is the foundation of **semantic search**.
